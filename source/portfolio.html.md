* Hired and Manages 3 remote teams of awesome software engineers.
* [Ensures the culture is strong and vibrant](https://medium.com/@gammons/4-awesome-ways-to-level-up-your-dev-team-32ab43f90678#.z6bh97clv), even though we are all remote.  Developer happiness and productivity are my primary concerns, while at the same time keeping accountability with the business side.

## Open source: Todolist

[Todolist][todolist] is an open source command-line task management app written in Go.

* Can be installed using Homebrew via `brew install todolist`.
* There is a [web view](http://demo.todolist.site) which is a single-page app that displays your todolist in a browser.  The web view is a single-page app (SPA ) coded with React/Redux, ES6.

## Open source:  fake_arel

[fake_arel][fa] is a gem I wrote in 2010 that allowed developers to use Rails 3 query syntax in Rails 2.  It accomplished this by clever use of named scopes.

* We used this in production at PipelineDeals for a year or so while we refactored our app and readied it for Rails 3.
* Worked as advertised, as we were able to drop out fake_arel and begin using Rails 3 arel seamlessly.
* fake_arel was featured on the [Ruby5 podcast][r5] in 2010.
