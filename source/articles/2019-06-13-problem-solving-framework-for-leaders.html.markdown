* Decisions
* Things that need to be done
* Problems / Issues



## Big decisions

If it's a *big decision* 

use a [decision-making framework](1).

* It avoids the team being steamrolled by the loudest person in the room.
* Do you have the internal expertise to *make* the decision as a team?  If not, consider hiring an outside expert to help.

Example: We want to partner with company B to handle our 

## Things that need to be done

Is the thing strategic to the business?


## Strategic things

Things that are strategic to the business should be done internally by the company.  It's unwise to outsource strategic initiatives.

Is this strategic thing a long-term effort?  Then consider setting up a delivery team of folks to work on that effort continuously.

*Example*: We want to have a mobile app in addition to our web-based app.

Inputs:
* This is strategic to the business.
* It will be a long-term effort (e.g. not a short-term or fixed-length project) 

**Things that are not strategic**

If it's not strategic, then outsource or buy a solution off the shelf.  It's not worth using internal company resources.

## Handling engineering problems / issues

* Do we have the team we need to handle this problem 
* will the issue continue to be a problem, even after we fix it this one time?
* Is it a "problem" or ongoing work that will continue to recur?

#### Example: we see a spike in spammer signups.  

**Inputs:**
* This _will_ continue to be a problem, even after we fix it this one time.
* Therefore, this is ongoing work that will continue to recur

**Remediation**

* Short term: have an engineer shut down the spammers.
* Long term: Create a compliance team with the right members on it, and set their direction to be focued on eliminating spammers on the system.

For things that you identify will continue to be a problem, it needs to be solved via team structure.

## Urgency

Urgency is a dimension to explore with all 3 of these things.  Is it something that must be done _right now_ or can it be planned for next quarter?
