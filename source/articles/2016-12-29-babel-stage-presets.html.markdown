I wrote a quick reference on maturity Stages for ESnext Javascript features.  It's important be careful using features that are in stage 2 and below.

To get an idea of which features are in which stage, reference the [ECMAScript compatibility table](http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/esnext/).

This quick reference is also [hosted on CodePen.](https://codepen.io/gammons/full/yVmzBR/)  Enjoy!
